# Branch-Predictor

The project was undertaken as part of ECE 521 - Computer Design & Technology (Computer Architeture)

Project Details
The project is implemented in C++.
The Simulator models and analyses the component 'Branch Predictors' which is responsible for predicting if a given instruction will take the branch or not. Branch Predictors help the instruction pipeline speculative on which instruction to fetch next when a branch instruction is seen, which reduces the stall cycles in the program execution. 

The Simulator models the following predictors alongwith BTB support:

1. Bimodal

2. Gshare

3. Yeh/Patt

4. Hybrid
